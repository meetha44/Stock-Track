# Stock-Track
Stock Track is a stock market website aimed at beginner investors created as part of my final year project. The website allows users to create an account so that stocks can be saved and viewed later on. Users can search for stocks and save, where they can be viewed on the 'My Account' page. AlphaVantage API was used to retrieve finance information and another API was created to query the database (shown in "dbRouter.js"). This repository only displays a few features since the file size is too large to upload to GitHub. The file "NavBar.js" displays how the search function (shown in "Search bar.mp4") works. The "StockQuote.js" file shows how the functions shown in "5. Stock Quote.mp4" and "6.Saving stock to user account and database.mp4" are implemented.
