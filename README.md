# Stock-Track
A stock market website aimed at beginner investors created as part of my final year project. This repository only displays a few features since the file size is too large to upload to GitHub. The file "NavBar.js" displays how the search function shown in "Search bar.mp4" works. The "StockQuote.js" file shows how the functions shown in "5. Stock Quote.mp4" and "6.Saving stock to user account and database.mp4" are implemented.
