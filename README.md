# Stock-Track
A website created as part of my final year project. This repository only displays a few features since the file size is too large to upload to GitHub. The file "NavBar.js" displays how the search function shown in "Search bar.mp4" works. The "StockQuote.js" file shows how the function shown in "5. Stock Quote.mp4" is implemented.
